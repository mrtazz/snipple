# NAME

snipple â€” a simple snippet manager


# SYNOPSIS

`snipple list [--alfred]`

`snipple get <snippet>`



# EXAMPLES

`snipple list`
: Lists all snippets in the snippet directory.

`snipple get rust/test.snippet`
: Prints the `rust/test.snippet` snippet from the snippet directory.


# DESCRIPTION

`snipple` is a command line utility to manage reusable snippets of text. The
core idea is that snippets should just be text files in a directory structure
that can be managed within a filesystem. This enables a flexible way of
interacting and managing snippets via e.g. syncing with cloud services or
tools like `rsync`, or tracking changes with version control tooling like
`git`.

# CONFIGURATION

In order to support configuration of behaviour `snipple` looks for
configuration in the locations `~/.config/snipple/config.yaml` and
`~/.snipple.yaml`. The config file can contain the following properties:

**base_dir:**
: the base location to look for snippets in

**snippet_suffix:**
: the suffix that is being used for snippet files


# META OPTIONS AND COMMANDS

`--help`
